# About PEO-DHMS

The Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems (PEO DHMS) is an acquisition organization with a direct reporting relationship to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&S)), and administratively attached to the Defense Health Agency. The purpose of the organization is to drive patient-centered healthcare through modern solutions.

In order to do that, our goals are to:

* Become a world-class technology organization.
* Continuously deliver capabilities.
* Enhance patient experience through seamless transition of care.
* Accelerate healthcare IT improvements.

Established in 2014, PEO DHMS oversees three program offices:

1. The **Joint Operational Medicine Information Systems (JOMIS)** program office provides health information technology capabilities to meet existing and emerging operational medicine requirements. JOMIS develops and deploys modernized and enhanced capabilities across the full breadth of operational medicine health care functions, including health care delivery, patient movement, medical command and control, medical situational awareness and medical logistics.

2. The **DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM)**program office oversees the deployment of the single, electronic health record within the Department of Defense (DoD) and sustains the Joint Longitudinal Viewer (JLV), a clinical application that provides integrated, read-only displays of health data from DoD, VA, Coast Guard and private sector partners. Deployment tasks include business operations management, testing, systems engineering, development of future requirements, change management, communications, training, and legacy operations. In August 2016, the Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX) moved under DHMSM as it supports integrated sharing of standardized health data among federal and private sector partners .

3. The **Enterprise Intelligence and Data Solutions (EIDS)** enables seamless data services and provides decision support for clinicians, patients, beneficiaries, analysts, researchers and DoD leadership. The program office oversees a number of program activities which support Military Health System strategic goals and facilitate informed decision-making through the delivery of robust information services and data in a timely, relevant and actionable manner.. EIDS manages data warehouse consolidation for legacy systems, offers and maintains a suite of data tools, and provides data scientist expertise. In the future, EIDS and DMIX will combine to drive new and expanded data-sharing and data analytic capabilities across the MHS

As a federal health IT leader, PEO DHMS values the following ideals:

* Innovation – To achieve results, PEO DHMS must look beyond the “now” and devise strategies to guide their capabilities into the future. They focus on inventive methods, anticipate risks, and prepare for contingencies.
* Superior Execution– All delivered solutions must be of high quality and deliver timely, customer-focused results.
* Responsiveness– Transparent communications allow them to innovate, whether to their functional community, beneficiaries, health IT partners, Congress <!-- We follow AP style (no Oxford / terminal commas except in sentences involving serial phrases like the last sentence in EIDS’ description) -->or auditors.
* Fiscal Accountability – Make every dollar count by striving to maintain efficient, effective fiscal stewardship.

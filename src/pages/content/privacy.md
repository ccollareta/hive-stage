## Privacy Policy

This notice provides the Program Executive Office, Defense Healthcare Management Systems (PEO DHMS) privacy policy regarding the nature, purpose, use, and sharing of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) collected via this website. Our privacy policy explains our information practices when you provide PII to us, whether collected online or offline, or when you visit us online to browse, obtain information, or conduct a transaction. PII may include: your name, email, mailing and/or home address, phone numbers, or other information that identifies you personally. We do require you to register to join the community conversations and groups, but anonymous registration is allowed.

The PII you provide on this website will be used for direct communication to you, and may be publicly listed within our Users Lists on the Hive Community. We will protect your information consistent with the principles of the **[Privacy Act of 1974](http://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacyact1974.htm)** , the **[E-Government Act of 2002](#contentTop)** , and the **[Federal Records Act](http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/laws/)** .

##### Personally Identifiable Information

As a general rule, PEO DHMS does not collect PII about you when you visit our website, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Submitting PII through our website is voluntary. By doing so, you are giving the PEO DHMS your permission to use the information for the stated purpose. However, not providing certain information may result in an inability to provide you with the service you desire.

If you choose to provide us with PII on a this website, through such methods as completing a web form or sending us an email, we will use that information to help us provide you the information or service you have requested or to respond to your message. The information we may receive from you varies based on what you do when visiting our site.

Generally, the information requested by PEO DHMS will be used to respond to your inquiry, provide you with updates, or open direct contact channels between you, PEO DHMS, and its partners. PEO DHMS will not provide you information to be used for purposes unrelated to the intent described above.

##### Personal Health Information

PEO DHMS will never collect nor request personal health information (PHI) about you when you visit our website. Furthermore, any PHI found to have been posted in our community will be deleted.

##### Email

This site will allow you to send us an email. We will use the information you provide to respond to your inquiry. We will only send you general information via email. You should be reminded that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. Therefore, we insist that you do not send sensitive personal data (such as your Social Security number) or personal health information (PHI) to us via email. If your intended email communication is very sensitive, or includes information such as your bank account, credit card, or Social Security number, you should instead send it by U.S. mail. Another alternative may be submission of data through a secure web page, if available.

Electronic mail messages that meet the definition of records in the ***[Federal Records Act](https://foia.state.gov/)*** (44 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) are covered under the same disposition schedule as all other Federal records. This means that emails you send us will be preserved and maintained for varying periods of time if those emails meet the definition of Federal records. Electronic messages that are not records are deleted when no longer needed.

##### Automatically Collected Information

We collect and temporarily store certain information about your visit for use in site management and security purposes only. We collect and analyze this information because it helps us to better design our website to suit your needs. We may also automatically collect information about the web content you view in the event of a known security or virus threat. This information includes:

1. The Internet domain from which you access our website (for example, “xcompany.com” if you use a private Internet access account, or “yourschool.edu” if you connect from an educational domain);

2. The Internet Protocol (IP) address (a unique number for each computer connected to the Internet) from which you access our website;

3. The type of browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome) used to access our site;

4. The operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, Unix) used to access our site;

5. The date and time you access our site;

6. The Universal Resource Locators (URLs), or addresses, of the pages you visit;

8. If you visited this website from another website, the URL of the forwarding site.

We may share the above information with our employees or representatives with a “need-to-know” in the performance of their official duties, other Federal agencies, or other named representatives as needed to quickly process your request or transaction. This information is only used to help us make our site more useful for you. Raw data logs are retained temporarily as required for security and site management purposes only. More information about how we share information can be found in our ***[Privacy Act Systems of Records Notices](https://www.state.gov/system-of-records-notices-privacy-office/)***.

##### Information Collected for Tracking and Customization (Cookies)

A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to your computer to allow it to remember specific information about your session while you are connected. Your computer will only share the information in the cookie with the website that provided it, and no other website can request it. There are two types of cookies:

* **Session:** Session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie is deleted. Websites may use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through the site, or to allow you to customize your preferences for interacting with the site.
* **Persistent:** Persistent cookies are saved on a user’s hard drive in order to determine which users are new to the site or are returning, and for repeat visitors, to block recurring invitations to take the ForeSee satisfaction survey.

If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can **[turn cookies off](https://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions)** in your browser. You will still have access to all information and resources at PEO DHMS websites. However, turning off cookies may affect the functioning of some PEO DHMS websites. Be aware that disabling cookies in your browser will affect cookie usage at all other websites you visit as well.

##### Security

PEO DHMS takes the security of all PII very seriously. We take precautions to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the information we collect at this site. Such measures include access controls designed to limit access to the information to the extent necessary to accomplish our mission. We also employ various security technologies to protect the information stored on our systems. We routinely test our security measures to ensure that they remain operational and effective.

We take the following steps to secure the information we collect:

* Employ internal access controls to ensure that only personnel who have access to your information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties.
* Train appropriate personnel on our privacy and security policies and compliance requirements.
* Secure the areas where we retain paper copies of the information we collect online.
* Perform regular backups of the information we collect online to ensure against loss.
* Use technical controls to secure the information we collect online including, but not limited to:

  * Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
  * Encryption
  * Firewalls
  * Password protections
* Periodically test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance.
* Employ external access safeguards to identify and prevent unauthorized access by outsiders that attempt to “hack” into, or cause harm to, the information contained in our systems.

We hold our contractors and other third-party providers to the same high standards that we use to ensure the security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal information they may have access to in the course of their work completed on behalf of PEO DHMS.

  Workforce 3.0 (WF3) represents a paradigm shift in how PEO DHMS achieves
  success in middle- and back-office operations. Rather than focusing on the
  quantity of labor, WF3 leaves the offeror responsible for mission outcomes and
  incentivizes best practices. new processes, methods, and/or best-in-class
  methodologies from private sector to enable the entire PEO DHMS workforce to
  deliver world-class technology.

Welcome Partners. I’m Holly Joers, the Acting Program Executive Officer of the Program Executive Office Defense Healthcare Management Systems – PEO DHMS. 
I am incredibly excited about the opportunity to work together, bring about lasting transformation in Healthcare IT, and elevate the level of care we can provide to our Nation’s service members, their families, and Veterans.  

Moving forward, we are shifting the paradigm in how we typically work with our partners. Instead of putting out a Request for Proposal (RFP) with our requirements, we will look to you to determine those requirements based on how we want to transform our organization. With our evolution in thinking, the goal is for PEO DHMS to become a world-class technology organization that continues to evolve and deliver new capabilities that enhance the patient experience. 

The PEO was established in 2014 with the mission to “transform the delivery of healthcare and advance data sharing through a modernized electronic health record for service members, veterans and their families.”  Our shared work will bring us closer to the achievement of that mission. 

Looking forward to the evolution of our work and partnership.

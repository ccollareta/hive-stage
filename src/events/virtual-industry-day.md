Moving forward, PEO DHMS is shifting the paradigm in how it typically works with partner organizations. Instead of putting out a Request for Proposal (RFP) including requirements, PEO DHMS will look to you to determine those requirements based on desired outcomes. 

As an organization, PEO DHMS continues to transform its approach in becoming a leader in the Health IT industry. In an effort to improve health outcomes via innovative Health IT solutions, PEO DHMS commits to modernizing its thinking including:

* Transformation efforts to mature the organization;
* Overhaul of the tools it uses;
* Renovation of how it does business. 

The organization’s goal is for its technologies and conduct to be indistinguishable from those of leading private-sector technology firms.  One transformation initiative of note in these times is the migration to a digital workforce that excels through a modern digital-focused workplace.  Learn more about this effort on Friday October 30th at Virtual Industry Day. 

Dive deeper into what PEO DHMS will be discussing and review the first draft of the Request for Proposal in advance of Virtual Industry Day.

PEO DHMS is looking for Industry Day involvement from both the traditional systems integrator community and innovative technologies who may be a part of the solution stack but not the comprehensive solution. If you’ve participated in events with PEO DHMS in the past or are attending for the first time, we encourage you to verify your eligibility on the [System for Award Management (SAM)](https://beta.sam.gov).

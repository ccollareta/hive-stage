I wanted to stimulate some conversation here.

Every time we introduce someone new to this WF3 approach, one of the first things we hear is, "Man, this is complicated."

My first gut reaction is always, "but this is a $10B to $15B portfolio, how simple can it be and have it be effective"?

It's interesting, we aren't buying fancy jet fighters or aircraft carriers. We're mostly buying commercial technology or technologies that could be delivered by commercial product firms. We also spend over a billion dollars every year. If you were to compare us to a commercial firm in that range, I bet you'd find they're organized in relatively complex ways.

Having come up here in 2013, I'd tend to argue we've probably managed to "get by" with too simple for many years, and we're now straining to properly operate with the structures we have in place.

As we outline in DRFP1, we want the WF3 partner to be champion, and a driving force for modernizing and developing our mid- and back-office functions to what they need to be to both support an organization of this size and to help us position ourselves for mission growth. Companies seek revenue/profit growth, we're no different, we just don't have the profit motive. We do want to help more users in more ways.

To me, this is the clearest place we can align our mutual interest with industry. Every mechanism in DRFP1 is meant to achieve that goal. I know it's complex, possibly even bordering on appearing chaotic, but we've spent a lot of time considering each element and bringing a lot of expertise to bear.

Rather than take a one size fits all approach to putting this together, we've borrowed from many succesful industry models like hedge fund management, venture capital partnerships, managed service models, product design principles, etc. The intent is to hit something tailored that takes the best constructs and applies them to our outcomes. None of this is random!

I definitely want to hear about our construct. I want to hear suggestions about linking rewards, behavior, and outcomes. We're open to input.

I will tell you up front: we aren't going to change because a particular team can't adapt to or work in a certain model. We aren't going to change something because it's hard or complex. We WILL change something if our understanding of the linkage between a mechanism and our outcome is misguided and won't deliver success.

To be candid, some of these will favor certain organizational models or experience sets over others, even within different portions of the RFP (I'm not sure any prime would score highly in every factor). Our outcomes are critical to our success, so we are setting a high bar. We must have teams that understand how to be good at the product delivery we want to be good at, at the scale we want to achieve. This is going to require careful thought and tailoring of your teams as well. We encourage really creative teaming arrangements.

I will post some more thoughts about potential teaming that in a separate blog post soon.

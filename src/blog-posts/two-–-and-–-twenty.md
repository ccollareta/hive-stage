Good afternoon HIVE community! Here is a video of Tony Kwag where he takes us through the 2-and-20 concept, the DHMS pain-points that led to the concept, the inspiration from Industry, and what this means for Offerors.

I think it’s important to show that we’re walking the walk when it comes to “seamless/badgeless”.

When we first started discussing the reward model, I had a lot of pain points, and I had some inkling of how I wanted to attack it, but no real concrete way to get at it. When I expressed my desire, Tony quickly generated this idea, and after we kicked it around for a few sessions, I’m very excited to see how it works out.

I figured, who better to talk to you about the model than the person who brought it up (I can feel the terror of millions of contracting officials through the Contracting Force)?

That said, I did want to throw in my two cents, because, to me, this is one of the most profound reflections of the underlying difference in this effort and a traditional effort, at least as we intend it.\
\
Human beings succeed, human beings create art, human beings make the conceptual leaps that AIs (currently) can’t. Contracts don’t do these things. ContractORs don’t do these things. I don’t think we always do the best job (either industry or Government, but especially Government) of understanding that it’s not the line number on a BOE that has great ideas, it’s not the boxes under our name on our org chart, it’s the human beings. Sometimes we lose sight of how human beings function – at our core we’re crude organic machines who respond to various stimuli all day long. But just think about all the beautiful things we've done through history.

Rather than looking at our contracts as mere vehicles to shuffle money between the Government and industry, we wanted to ensure that they harness those stimuli to maximize the productivity of our relationships.

One clear example I used to hear all the time, “I’ll get fired if I don’t get an excellent CPARS”. CPARS can’t be (and isn’t, if we’re being truthful) very helpful if everyone is “Excellent”. It’s a very easy to understand disconnect that creates a mutually exclusive benefit between Government and industry.

More germane to this post, I occasionally hear, especially from senior level folks, I won’t be able to capture my bonus if you negotiate our profit down. I don’t hate that. For one thing, I appreciate the honesty, and secondly I understand it. I’m a human being too. I have the same dreams. I would love to start a small business, grow it to a mid-size and sell it to a large business for seven or eight figures so I can buy a nice penthouse downtown and hang out in Adams Morgan

I also know that most of us, especially in this sector, are both really proud of and motivated by the mission itself, but I also know we’re kidding ourselves if we say or believe that individual rewards aren’t a huge motivator too.

Getting down to the human, personal level, when I came to DHA, I wasn’t totally convinced. I had a great career brewing at the Navy, and I was pretty confident I was going to go very far. I also knew DC is expensive and I wanted to be able to buy some property to live. Accordingly, I asked for and insisted on getting a pretty big bonus to make the switch. I knew I’d never have the level of leverage again that I had coming off the heels of pulling off the MHS GENESIS contract. We all do it. I get it.

I don’t want to avoid that. I don’t think we need to. I actually love how powerful those individual motivations can be. I just want to harness those rewards towards satisfying our outcomes, and if possible use them as a force multiplier.

We like this model because we think it at least creates the conditions where everyone up and down your firm can “eat”. Maybe it’s because I came up in finance post-Enron and post-Sarbanes Oxley, but I’ve always been somewhat fascinated by the impact of executive compensation strategies. We hope by flipping the script it means you’re much more powerfully motivated to fix problems than to just throw bodies and try to expand margins around the edges. Hopefully, this means if we’re successful, your CEO gets that new beach house or Aston Martin – but only if it creates even greater value for the Government (which doesn’t even have to be monetary). We don’t want the C-suite/boards/shareholders creating the wrong pressures on our success, and this is an interesting way to get at that.

We’ve actually heard a lot that this model is risky because so much about working with the Government is out of your control. I actually disagree – it’s not a risk, at least not as I understand the word. I think we can be clear eyed about this. The government IS GOING to get in your way. Probably a lot. Whether it’s folks within our programs or PEO, whether it’s folks at DHA proper, whether it’s folks in the DoD CIO shop, someone is going to need convincing. The intent is for the reward model to be so powerful that you won’t sit idly back and allow things to happen, you take ownership, you influence, you keep at it – pro-active, high-agency, data driven approaches. It’s oversimplifying, but a lot of the value WF3 will bring is in influence – the more influential your team, the more value you bring, and the higher your rewards.

While this will be persistently challenging (if you’re looking for easy business, this is NOT the opportunity for your firm), I think it will turn out to be rewarding. We’ve seen this model work. Back in 2015, we decided to go with commercial hosting for our EHR. This was at the height of the data-center consolidation trend. There were significant cyber security concerns. We had to do a lot of convincing at the Under Secretary level, the DoD CIO level, even in Congress. We were able to do that because our contractor armed us with incredibly persuasive rationale that made it very clear it was the right thing to do.

I can’t understate the impact of making that decision. We’ve been able to deliver substantially more capabilities than we would have if we were in a DISA DECC. We’ve been able to do it in a very cost-effective way. We’ve avoided substantial delays in rolling out the EHR due to reconfiguration. Perhaps most importantly, we’ve been much better able to keep up with the state of the art in commercial EHR, and we’ve been able to satisfy the requirement to have one record with the VA. It was hard, but there’s no doubt in my mind it was the right decision.

We’ve done it in the past; I believe we will make decisions like that again in the future. I hope that this structure will help you want to help us take the more difficult roads, and reward you when we pull it off.

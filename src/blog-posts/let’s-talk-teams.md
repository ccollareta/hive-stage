I wanted to share some thoughts about what I think is probably the most important, certainly one of the most important, keys to WF3 being successful.

The teams that people bring to the table.

I’d argue we’ve been pretty successful at this on our prime product side. This is our first attempt at enabling contracts (all of the enabling contracts we’ve used to date have been issued by other contracting offices, not mine).

Since we awarded the MHS GENESIS contract in 2015, I have *never* felt as though we were operating in a traditional prime/sub arrangement. Not from the first day. It hasn’t been perfect (what relationship is? I have more coming on how we view relationships soon), but this has been a major key to our success with MHS GENESIS, I think just about anyone would tell you. I know I’ve spoken to many different players and this is oft cited as key. In the MHS GENESIS draft/RFP cycle we made sure we let you all know how important a genuine team/partner relationship was, and we got it, to our benefit.

That said, I’m not one to rest on our laurels, and I believe the relationship we structure for WF3 will be even more critical to our success. We need trust and transparency, and we need to share risk and reward to align our motivations. Do you know why? Because we’re trying something really hard (I’ll talk more about this in another post as well). Commercial organizations struggle with this level of transformation; the literature is extensive, failure is common, we’ll probably experience it to some extent, especially at first.

We need teams with a very diverse set of successes and expertise. We need people who have proven they can sustain disruptive change. We need people who will champion this effort from within and continue to challenge the status quo. We’ll need people to pick us up off the mat when something goes wrong; to let us know that these challenges are common and can be overcome. We need people who have successfully operated in the industry we will be in (producing great technology).

I sat through a meeting late Friday where people were very passionately making assumptions/assertions about technologies our developers need, when they don’t know anything whatsoever about what our developers will need to accomplish what we’re setting out to do. Not many people will say, but I will, *we do not know how to accomplish this on our own*. We don’t know enough to overcome the naysayers. If you’ve read the DRFP1 section about our Gate factors, hopefully you can see how we are trying to make sure we get these critical components in place.

This is existential for PEO DHMS. We’ve done some good things with the EHR and JLV, but if we’re not careful, that’s all we will ever do. This isn’t some grand, aspirational goal (though we also have aspirational growth strategies), we have a lot of other current requirements that we have, frankly, stumbled around delivering, either we’ve taken way too long to get something available, or we’ve put out a half-baked product that doesn’t consider user experience and no one uses it. This is more common than we like to admit.

The bottom line is, we can’t afford to have anything less than the best possible team driving this effort.

I tortured myself and went back and forth with the team about how much of this to put in DRFP1. At the end of the day, we didn’t want to stifle creativity, because we know we don’t know the right answer, so I didn’t put any of my ideas in.

All that said, I see two things I’m thinking a lot about and want to address with WF3.

1. Rewarding meaningful workshare. We want the best ideas, regardless of the company. You’ll see some of that in DRFP1.

2. Forming the right teams.

I want to foot stomp, we are *very* open to uncommon arrangements. We’re going to leave it up to you, in your proposal, to show us what the right answer is and what the value is.

Are we open to a venture-type arrangement where the prime is maybe like the limited partner, providing advice and expertise, finding the right and facilitating the general partners (subs), etc.? Sure! I could even envision a scenario like this where the right small business could maybe prime the contract, perform 15% of the work, and stay under the small business thresholds. I could see a non-traditional priming in this model. Bottom line is, we don’t need a prime that performs the bulk of the work and does all of the traditional prime functions. I think the reward structure we’ve outlined could make this attractive. We’re rewarding you for our success, not how many hours you deliver.

Are we open to a quasi-consortium similar to how some of the other transactions run? Maybe?!

Don’t limit yourself, and please give us feedback on how our reward structures could be changed to drive the right teams.

Secondly, I worked in industry for a while (even though it was more years in the past than I care to admit), and I know there are some powerful rivalries out there. I think that’s fine, it drives us all forward. That said, I hope the importance of this effort to our National strategy, and our reward structure, might push folks to rethink some of these arrangements.

I’ve evaluated a lot of proposals, and I have *never, not one time*, not had regrets that I couldn’t get some elements from each prime proposal. I’d urge you to think about that, and if there is a way I can reward teaming, please let me know.

I’d also like everyone to think about this question. I’ve thought about it a lot, and I can’t get a lot of candid feedback. What are the attributes of a good prime? How do you know if you should prime or sub? How do we help you make that decision?

Thanks,

Matt

excerpt: Over the last 50 years, one thing has been evident – organizations that
  are unable to adapt to changing technology lose value and collapse. This has
  been shown in industry with businesses such as Sears and Blockbuster. This has
  led industry to use the phrase “agility” to describe an organization’s ability
  to adapt to new technologies.

Over the last 50 years, one thing has been evident – organizations that are unable to adapt to changing technology lose value and collapse. This has been shown in industry with businesses such as Sears and Blockbuster. This has led industry to use the phrase “agility” to describe an organization’s ability to adapt to new technologies.

We at PEO DHMS realize we are no exception. PEO DHMS must be able to adapt to new technology to provide quality Healthcare IT to the Defense Health Community. We have developed an acquisition strategy that enable agility within the government.

**PEO 3.0**

PEO 3.0 is the foundation by which PEO DHMS will transform itself to deliver premier Healthcare IT of the future. Looking to industry leaders in IT Product development and industry best practices, we developed 4 key cornerstones. Each cornerstone is structured to enable PEO DHMS to transform into an agile organization by creating contract vehicles that provide itself access to incentivized partners and technology.

**The 4 Cornerstones**

**Workforce 3.0** will identify trusted partners to do product management, testing, engineering, administrative tasks, and more. These partners will make up the core support of PEO 3.0, helping to drive the direction and day-to-day operations of the PEO itself. We have chosen to depict them as architects and foremen, as they will drive the direction of our product portfolio and ensure product delivery and client satisfaction.

**DevMac** will identify the partners to design, develop, deploy, and operate our Healthcare IT products. With technologies such as containers, virtualization, cloud, and CI/CD, we have come to understand that operations and development are closely tied. Therefore, we will identify collaborators who understand this principle and can bring these skills to support our products. We have chosen to depict them as construction workers, as they are the builders for our organization.

**Workplace 3.0** can be seen as the counterpart of Workforce 3.0, in that it will provide our Workforce 3.0 partners with physical space, services, and collaboration technologies to create a modern digital work environment. This approach brings together the important digital and physical components of the modern workplace, which is a cornerstone of culture and productivity. For this reason, we have depicted it as the office building and collaboration space.

**XaaS**, or X as a Service, is the counterpart of DevMac. The trends in serverless, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS models have shown that the foundation of IT products is no longer a bare set of servers sitting in a data center. Our XaaS Partners will provide underlying capabilities, software, infrastructure, and platforms on which our products will be built.

**Products**

We would be remiss if we didn’t touch on our Products. Our product line exists to serve the Defense Community. PEO 3.0’s goal is to increase our capability to go above and beyond in that service. In order to do this, we must be able to create develop and deploy quality, user focused products and get them to the community.

The PEO 3.0 strategy involves much more than just the 4 cornerstones, as you have probably seen over the last few months. One important change is our outreach to the community though HIVE. As we continue to move through these acquisitions, we look forward to feedback and discussion.
